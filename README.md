**Instructions for Penguinassessed Project:**

This project aims to analyse data (culmen width vs culmen length, across 3 Penguin species) from the “palmerpenguins” R package (Horst AM,et al, 2020). The repository includes files, containing the following information:
- "penguin_analysis.Rmd" contains an R markdown with various statistical analysis techniques analysing these data- a linear regressions, ANCOVA, and Z-test for differences between r coefficients (penguin_analysis.html, is a rendered version of the Rmd file). 
- "functions", any functions used in this code are saved in seperate R files. 
- "renv.lock" file contains all the package dependencies required for this code, use "renv::restore()" to instate all the package-versions required for this code. 
- "figures" contains all figures produced in the .Rmd code.
- "data" contains all the data used, both raw (unedited) and clean (with formatted column names), are saved as csv files in the data folder.
